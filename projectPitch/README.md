# Intrvl - Custom Interval Timers

Intrvl allows you to easily create custom interval timers. Use these to time workouts, meditation sessions, or test administration. You can create repeating timer sections within the overall timer, add sounds or text-to-speech notifications when the next interval starts, and much more!

## RESTful Routes

There are no routes for tags (categories), timer sections, or sounds, since these will be integrated in other views (eg. showing the user's tags on their profile page, and showing a timer's sections on that timer's page)

## MVP Goals

- Allow users to sign up / login
- Allow users to create / edit / delete timers
- Allow user to access all their timers and use them
- Use TTS API to announce when a timer is starting and ending

## Stretch Goals

- Allow timers to have 'sections' that can be repeated
- Allow sections to be rearranged and edited
- Allow user to duplicate an existing timer to use as a template
- Allow user to set some timers as public, and others as private
- Allow user to set custom messages or sounds to be played when a timer section starts / ends
- Style with TailwindCSS
